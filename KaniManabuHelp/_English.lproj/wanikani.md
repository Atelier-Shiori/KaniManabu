KaniManabu can take avantage of WaniKani's API to view Kanji Breakdown and check for vocabulary that is on WaniKani.

# Kanji Breakdown
When you provide a WaniKani token, you can view the Kanji breakdown of a vocabulary word in Item view and Learning Mode. The app will only show a breakdown of Kanji available on WaniKani. Information available for each Kanji from WaniKani are the English meaning, Other Meanings, Level, On'yomi/Kun'yomi readings, Reading Mnemonic, and Reading Hint.

# Vocabulary Check
With a WaniKani token, KaniManabu can check if the vocabulary exists on WaniKani first. If it exists, it will show an indicator saying it exists. If this indicator doesn't appear, it doesn't exist on WaniKani.  You can still add the card if you want.

# Free Subscription Limitations
If you have a free WaniKani account, you will only have access to content from the first three levels. This is to comply with the terms of service with the API. This limitation does not apply to accounts with active subscriptions and lifetime memberships.
